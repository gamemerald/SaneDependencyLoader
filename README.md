# Sane Dependency Loader
*A VERY* crappy dependency downloader (loader)

## Usage
Add a depends.json in your .minecraft folder!
Here is an exmaple depends.json: 
```
{
  "examplemod-name": "https://examplesite.com/example.jar"
}
```

## Oh no!
You will notic that the following window pops up: <br>

Do not worry! This just means that mods have been newly added and you should just relaunch the game!
